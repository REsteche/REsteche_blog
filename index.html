Hello there! My name is Ruben Esteche, I’m a bachelor in physics and currently doing a M.Sc in foundations of quantum mechanics. I am also a programming enthusiast, always interested in learning and sharing more.
I’m currently working on temporal aspects, from a new arrival time distribution to tunneling time numerical modeling. I have also experience in causality relationships of events in quantum mechanics, and theory of information.

My main goal here is to organize my pernosal blog posts, here I intend to talk about physics, technology, programming and many other curiosities. and many other curiosities among my interests. I hope you like it!
