            "title": "nbdev + GitHub Codespaces: A New Literate Programming Environment",
            "content": "Today, we are going to show you how to set up a literate programming environment, allowing you to use an IDE (VS Code) and an interactive computing environment (Jupyter), without leaving your browser, for free, in under 5 minutes. You’ll even see how VSCode and Jupyter work together automatically! But first, what is literate programming? And how did I go from skeptic to a zealot of literate programming? . Introduction . Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated. According to Knuth, literate programming provides higher-quality programs by forcing programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program. This process makes poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. Knuth also claims that literate programming provides a first-rate documentation system, which is not an add-on, but is grown naturally in the process of exposition of one’s thoughts during a program’s creation. 1 . When I first learned about literate programming, I was quite skeptical. For the longest time, I had wrongly equated Jupyter notebooks with literate programming. Indeed, Jupyter is a brilliant interactive computing system, which was awarded the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award, and is loved by many developers. However, Jupyter falls short of the literate programming paradigm for the following reasons:2 . It can be difficult to compile source code from notebooks. | It can be difficult to diff and use version control with notebooks because they are not stored in plain text. | It is not clear how to automatically generate documentation from notebooks. | It is not clear how to properly run tests suites when writing code in notebooks. | . My skepticism quickly evaporated when I began using nbdev, a project that extends notebooks to complete the literate programming ideal. I spent a month, full time, using nbdev while contributing to the python library fastcore, and can report that Donald Knuth was definitely onto something. The process of writing prose and tests alongside code forced me to deeply understand why the code does what it does, and to think deeply about its design. Furthermore, the reduced cognitive load and speed of iteration of having documentation, code, and tests in one location boosted my productivity to levels I have never before experienced as a software developer. Furthermore, I found that developing this way bolstered collaboration such that code reviews not only happened faster but were more meaningful. In short, nbdev may be the most profound productivity tool I have ever used. . As a teaser, look how easy it is to instantiate this literate programming environment, which includes a notebook, a docs site and an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed! :point_down: . . Features of nbdev . As discussed in the docs, nbdev provides the following features: . Searchable, hyperlinked documentation, which can be automatically hosted on GitHub Pages for free. | Python modules, following best practices such as automatically defining __all__ with your exported functions, classes, and variables. | Pip and Conda installers. | Tests defined directly in notebooks which run in parallel. This testing system has been thoroughly tested with GitHub Actions. | Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and export any changes automatically back into your notebooks. | . Since you are in a notebook, you can also add charts, text, links, images, videos, etc, that are included automatically in the documentation of your library, along with standardized documentation generated automatically from your code. This site is an example of docs generated automatically by nbdev. . GitHub Codespaces . Thanks to Conda and nbdev_template, setting up a development environment with nbdev is far easier than it used to be. However, we realized it could be even easier, thanks to a new GitHub product called Codespaces. Codespaces is a fully functional development environment in your browser, accessible directly from GitHub, that provides the following features: . A full VS Code IDE. | An environment that has files from the repository mounted into the environment, along with your GitHub credentials. | A development environment with dependencies pre-installed, backed by Docker. | The ability to serve additional applications on arbitrary ports. For nbdev, we serve a Jupyter notebook server as well as a Jekyll based documentation site. | A shared file system, which facilitates editing code in one browser tab and rendering the results in another. | … and more. | Codespaces enables developers to immediately participate in a project without wasting time on DevOps or complicated setup steps. Most importantly, CodeSpaces with nbdev allows developers to quickly get started with creating their own software with literate programming. . A demo of nbdev + Codespaces . This demo uses the project fastai/fastcore, which was built with nbdev, as an example. First, we can navigate to this repo and launch a Codespace: . . If you are launching a fresh Codespace, it may take several minutes to set up. Once the environment is ready, we can verify that all dependencies we want are installed (in this case fastcore and nbdev): . . Additionally, we can serve an arbitrary number of applications on user-specified ports, which we can open through VSCode as shown below: . . In this case, these applications are a notebook and docs site. Changes to a notebook are reflected immediately in the data docs. Furthermore, we can use the cli command nbdev_build_lib to sync our notebooks with python modules. This functionality is shown below: . . This is amazing! With a click of a button, I was able to: . Launch an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed. | Launch two additional applications: a Jupyter Notebook server on port 8080 and a docs site on port 4000. | Automatically update the docs and modules every time I make a change to a Jupyter notebook. | This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are additional utilities for writing and executing tests, diffing notebooks, special flags for hiding, showing, and collapsing cells in the generated docs, as well as git hooks for automation. This and more functionality is covered in the nbdev docs. . Give It A Try For Yourself . To try out nbdev yourself, take this tutorial, which will walk you through everything you need to know. The tutorial also shows you how to use a repository template with the configuration files necessary to enable Codespaces with nbdev. . You Can Write Blogs With Notebooks, Too! . This blog post was written in fastpages which is also built on nbdev! We recommend fastpages if you want an easy way to blog with Jupyter notebooks. . Additional Resources . The GitHub Codepaces site. | The official docs for Codespaces. | The nbdev docs. | The nbdev GitHub repo. | fastpages: The project used to write this blog. | The GitHub repo fastai/fastcore, which is what we used in this blog post as an example. | . Wikipedia article: Literate Programming &#8617; . | This is not a criticism of Jupyter. Jupyter doesn’t claim to be a full literate programming system. However, people can sometimes (unfairly) judge Jupyter according to this criteria. &#8617; . |",

            "title": "Introducing fastlinkcheck",
            "content": ". Motivation . Recently, fastai has been hard at work improving and overhauling nbdev, a literate programming environment for python. A key feature of nbdev is automated generation of documentation from Jupyter notebooks. This documentation system adds many niceties, such as the following types of hyperlinks automatically: . Links to source code on GitHub. | Links to both internal and external documentation by introspecting variable names in backticks. | . Because documentation is so easy to create and maintain in nbdev, we find ourselves and others creating much more of it! In addition to automatic hyperlinks, we often include our own links to relevant websites, blogs and videos when documenting code. For example, one of the largest nbdev generated sites, docs.fast.ai, has more than 300 external and internal links at the time of this writing. . The Solution . Due to the continued popularity of fastai and the growth of new nbdev projects, grooming these links manually became quite tedious. We investigated solutions that could verify links for us automatically, but were not satisfied with any existing solutions. These are the features we desired: . A platform independent solution that is not tied to a specific static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo. | Intelligent introspection of external links that are actually internal links. For example, if we are building the site docs.fast.ai, a link to https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial should not result in a web request, but rather introspection of the local file system for the presence of tutorial.html in the right location. | Verification of any links to assets like CSS, data, javascript or other files. | Logs that are well organized that allow us to see each broken link or reference to a non-existent path, and the pages these are found in. | Parallelism to verify links as fast as possible. | Lightweight, easy to install with minimal dependencies. | . We tried tools such as linkchecker and pylinkvalidator, but these required your site to be first be hosted. Since we wanted to check links on a static site, hosting is overhead we wanted to avoid. . This is what led us to create fastlinkcheck, which we discuss below. . Note: For Ruby users, htmlproofer apperas to provide overlapping functionality. We have not tried this library. . A tour of fastlinkcheck . For this tour we will be referring to the files in the fastlinkcheck repo. You should clone this repo in the current directory in order to follow along: . git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastlinkcheck.git cd fastlinkcheck . Cloning into &#39;fastlinkcheck&#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 135, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (135/135), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (98/98), done. remote: Total 608 (delta 69), reused 76 (delta 34), pack-reused 473 Receiving objects: 100% (608/608), 1.12 MiB | 10.47 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (302/302), done. . Installation . You can install fastlinkcheck with pip: . pip install fastlinkcheck . Usage . After installing fastlinkcheck, the cli command link_check is available from the command line. We can see various options with the --help flag. . link_check --help . usage: link_check [-h] [--host HOST] [--config_file CONFIG_FILE] [--pdb] [--xtra XTRA] path Check for broken links recursively in `path`. positional arguments: path Root directory searched recursively for HTML files optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit --host HOST Host and path (without protocol) of web server --config_file CONFIG_FILE Location of file with urls to ignore --pdb Run in pdb debugger (default: False) --xtra XTRA Parse for additional args (default: &#39;&#39;) . From the root of fastlinkcheck repo, We can search the directory _example/broken_links recursively for broken links like this: . link_check _example/broken_links . ERROR: The Following Broken Links or Paths were found: - &#39;http://fastlinkcheck.com/test.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` - &#39;http://somecdn.com/doesntexist.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` - Path(&#39;/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.js&#39;) was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` . . Specifying the --host parameter allows you detect links that are internal by identifying links with that host name. External links are verified by making a request to the appropriate website. On the other hand, internal links are verified by inspecting the presence and content of local files. . We must be careful when using the --host argument to only pass the host (and path, if necessary) without the protocol. For example, this is how we specify the hostname if your site&#39;s url is http://fastlinkcheck.com/test.html: . link_check _example/broken_links --host fastlinkcheck.com . ERROR: The Following Broken Links or Paths were found: - &#39;http://somecdn.com/doesntexist.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` - Path(&#39;/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.js&#39;) was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` . . We now have one less broken link as there is indeed a file named test.html in the root of the path we are searching. However, if we add a path to the end of --host , such as fastlinkcheck.com/mysite the link would again be listed as broken because _example/broken_links/mysite/test.html does not exist: . link_check _example/broken_links --host fastlinkcheck.com/mysite . ERROR: The Following Broken Links or Paths were found: - &#39;http://fastlinkcheck.com/test.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` - &#39;http://somecdn.com/doesntexist.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` - Path(&#39;/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.js&#39;) was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` . . You can ignore links by creating a text file that contains a list of urls and paths to ignore. For example, the file _example/broken_links/linkcheck.rc contains: . cat _example/broken_links/linkcheck.rc . test.js https://www.google.com . We can use this file to ignore urls and paths with the --config_file argument. This will filter out references to the broken link /test.js from our earlier results: . link_check _example/broken_links --host fastlinkcheck.com --config_file _example/broken_links/linkcheck.rc . ERROR: The Following Broken Links or Paths were found: - &#39;http://somecdn.com/doesntexist.html&#39; was found in the following pages: - `/Users/hamelsmu/github/fastlinkcheck/_example/broken_links/test.html` . . Finally, if there are no broken links, link_check will not return anything. The directory _example/no_broken_links/ does not contain any HTML files with broken links: . link_check _example/no_broken_links . No broken links found! . Python . You can also use these utilities from python instead of the terminal. Please see these docs for more information. . Using link_check in GitHub Actions . The link_check CLI utility that is installed with fastlinkcheck can be very useful in continuous integration systems like GitHub Actions. Here is an example GitHub Actions workflow that uses link_check: . name: Check Links on: [workflow_dispatch, push] jobs: check-links: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - uses: actions/setup-python@v2 - name: check for broken links run: | pip install fastlinkcheck link_check _example . We can a few more lines of code to open an issue instead when a broken link is found, using the gh cli: . ... - name: check for broken links run: | pip install fastlinkcheck link_check _example 2&gt; err || true export GITHUB_TOKEN=&quot;YOUR_TOKEN&quot; [[ -s err ]] &amp;&amp; gh issue create -t &quot;Broken links found&quot; -b &quot;$(&lt; err)&quot; -R &quot;yourusername/yourrepo&quot; . We can extend this even further to only open an issue when another issue with a specific label isn&#39;t already open: . ... - name: check for broken links run: | pip install fastlinkcheck link_check &quot;docs/_site&quot; --host &quot;docs.fast.ai&quot; 2&gt; err || true export GITHUB_TOKEN=&quot;YOUR_TOKEN&quot; if [[ -z $(gh issue list -l &quot;broken-link&quot;)) &amp;&amp; (-s err) ]]; then gh issue create -t &quot;Broken links found&quot; -b &quot;$(&lt; err)&quot; -l &quot;broken-link&quot; -R &quot;yourusername/yourrepo&quot; fi .

            "title": "fastcore: An Underrated Python Library",
            "content": ". Background . I recently embarked on a journey to sharpen my python skills: I wanted to learn advanced patterns, idioms, and techniques. I started with reading books on advanced Python, however, the information didn&#39;t seem to stick without having somewhere to apply it. I also wanted the ability to ask questions from an expert while I was learning -- which is an arrangement that is hard to find! That&#39;s when it occurred to me: What if I could find an open source project that has fairly advanced python code and write documentation and tests? I made a bet that if I did this it would force me to learn everything very deeply, and the maintainers would be appreciative of my work and be willing to answer my questions. . And that&#39;s exactly what I did over the past month! I&#39;m pleased to report that it has been the most efficient learning experience I&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ve discovered that writing documentation forced me to deeply understand not just what the code does but also why the code works the way it does, and to explore edge cases while writing tests. Most importantly, I was able to ask questions when I was stuck, and maintainers were willing to devote extra time knowing that their mentorship was in service of making their code more accessible! It turns out the library I choose, fastcore is some of the most fascinating Python I have ever encountered as its purpose and goals are fairly unique. . For the uninitiated, fastcore is a library on top of which many fast.ai projects are built on. Most importantly, fastcore extends the python programming language and strives to eliminate boilerplate and add useful functionality for common tasks. In this blog post, I&#39;m going to highlight some of my favorite tools that fastcore provides, rather than sharing what I learned about python. My goal is to pique your interest in this library, and hopefully motivate you to check out the documentation after you are done to learn more! . Why fastcore is interesting . Get exposed to ideas from other languages without leaving python: I’ve always heard that it is beneficial to learn other languages in order to become a better programmer. From a pragmatic point of view, I’ve found it difficult to learn other languages because I could never use them at work. Fastcore extends python to include patterns found in languages as diverse as Julia, Ruby and Haskell. Now that I understand these tools I am motivated to learn other languages. | You get a new set of pragmatic tools: fastcore includes utilities that will allow you to write more concise expressive code, and perhaps solve new problems. | Learn more about the Python programming language: Because fastcore extends the python programming language, many advanced concepts are exposed during the process. For the motivated, this is a great way to see how many of the internals of python work. | A whirlwind tour through fastcore . Here are some things you can do with fastcore that immediately caught my attention. . . Making **kwargs transparent . Whenever I see a function that has the argument **kwargs, I cringe a little. This is because it means the API is obfuscated and I have to read the source code to figure out what valid parameters might be. Consider the below example: . def baz(a, b=2, c=3, d=4): return a + b + c def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, **kwargs)&gt; . Without reading the source code, it might be hard for me to know that foo also accepts and additional parameters b and d. We can fix this with delegates: . def baz(a, b=2, c=3, d=4): return a + b + c @delegates(baz) # this decorator will pass down keyword arguments from baz def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4)&gt; . You can customize the behavior of this decorator. For example, you can have your cake and eat it too by passing down your arguments and also keeping **kwargs: . @delegates(baz, keep=True) def foo(c, a, **kwargs): return c + baz(a, **kwargs) inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2, d=4, **kwargs)&gt; . You can also exclude arguments. For example, we exclude argument d from delegation: . def basefoo(a, b=2, c=3, d=4): pass @delegates(basefoo, but=[&#39;d&#39;]) # exclude `d` def foo(c, a, **kwargs): pass inspect.signature(foo) . &lt;Signature (c, a, b=2)&gt; . You can also delegate between classes: . class BaseFoo: def __init__(self, e, c=2): pass @delegates()# since no argument was passsed here we delegate to the superclass class Foo(BaseFoo): def __init__(self, a, b=1, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs) inspect.signature(Foo) . &lt;Signature (a, b=1, c=2)&gt; . For more information, read the docs on delegates. . . Avoid boilerplate when setting instance attributes . Have you ever wondered if it was possible to avoid the boilerplate involved with setting attributes in __init__? . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b ,c): self.a, self.b, self.c = a, b, c . Ouch! That was painful. Look at all the repeated variable names. Do I really have to repeat myself like this when defining a class? Not Anymore! Checkout store_attr: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr() t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 . You can also exclude certain attributes: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b, c): store_attr(but=[&#39;c&#39;]) t = Test(5,4,3) assert t.b == 4 assert not hasattr(t, &#39;c&#39;) . There are many more ways of customizing and using store_attr than I highlighted here. Check out the docs for more detail. . P.S. you might be thinking that Python dataclasses also allow you to avoid this boilerplate. While true in some cases, store_attr is more flexible.1 . 1. For example, store_attr does not rely on inheritance, which means you won&#39;t get stuck using multiple inheritance when using this with your own classes. Also, unlike dataclasses, store_attr does not require python 3.7 or higher. Furthermore, you can use store_attr anytime in the object lifecycle, and in any location in your class to customize the behavior of how and when variables are stored.↩ . . Avoiding subclassing boilerplate . One thing I hate about python is the __super__().__init__() boilerplate associated with subclassing. For example: . class ParentClass: def __init__(self): self.some_attr = &#39;hello&#39; class ChildClass(ParentClass): def __init__(self): super().__init__() cc = ChildClass() assert cc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; # only accessible b/c you used super . We can avoid this boilerplate by using the metaclass PrePostInitMeta. We define a new class called NewParent that is a wrapper around the ParentClass: . class NewParent(ParentClass, metaclass=PrePostInitMeta): def __pre_init__(self, *args, **kwargs): super().__init__() class ChildClass(NewParent): def __init__(self):pass sc = ChildClass() assert sc.some_attr == &#39;hello&#39; . . Type Dispatch . Type dispatch, or Multiple dispatch, allows you to change the way a function behaves based upon the input types it receives. This is a prominent feature in some programming languages like Julia. For example, this is a conceptual example of how multiple dispatch works in Julia, returning different values depending on the input types of x and y: . collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting spaceship collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting asteroid collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting spaceship . Type dispatch can be especially useful in data science, where you might allow different input types (i.e. Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes) to a function that processes data. Type dispatch allows you to have a common API for functions that do similar tasks. . Unfortunately, Python does not support this out-of-the box. Fortunately, there is the @typedispatch decorator to the rescue. This decorator relies upon type hints in order to route inputs the correct version of the function: . @typedispatch def f(x:str, y:str): return f&#39;{x}{y}&#39; @typedispatch def f(x:np.ndarray): return x.sum() @typedispatch def f(x:int, y:int): return x+y . Below is a demonstration of type dispatch at work for the function f: . f(&#39;Hello &#39;, &#39;World!&#39;) . &#39;Hello World!&#39; . f(2,3) . 5 . f(np.array([5,5,5,5])) . 20 . There are limitations of this feature, as well as other ways of using this functionality that you can read about here. In the process of learning about typed dispatch, I also found a python library called multipledispatch made by Mathhew Rocklin (the creator of Dask). . After using this feature, I am now motivated to learn languages like Julia to discover what other paradigms I might be missing. . . A better version of functools.partial . functools.partial is a great utility that creates functions from other functions that lets you set default values. Lets take this function for example that filters a list to only contain values &gt;= val: . test_input = [1,2,3,4,5,6] def f(arr, val): &quot;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&quot; return [x for x in arr if x &gt;= val] f(test_input, 3) . [3, 4, 5, 6] . You can create a new function out of this function using partial that sets the default value to 5: . filter5 = partial(f, val=5) filter5(test_input) . [5, 6] . One problem with partial is that it removes the original docstring and replaces it with a generic docstring: . filter5.__doc__ . &#39;partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application n of the given arguments and keywords. n&#39; . fastcore.utils.partialler fixes this, and makes sure the docstring is retained such that the new API is transparent: . filter5 = partialler(f, val=5) filter5.__doc__ . &#39;Filter a list to remove any values that are less than val.&#39; . . Composition of functions . A technique that is pervasive in functional programming languages is function composition, whereby you chain a bunch of functions together to achieve some kind of result. This is especially useful when applying various data transformations. Consider a toy example where I have three functions: (1) Removes elements of a list less than 5 (from the prior section) (2) adds 2 to each number (3) sums all the numbers: . def add(arr, val): return [x + val for x in arr] def arrsum(arr): return sum(arr) # See the previous section on partialler add2 = partialler(add, val=2) transform = compose(filter5, add2, arrsum) transform([1,2,3,4,5,6]) . 15 . But why is this useful? You might me thinking, I can accomplish the same thing with: . arrsum(add2(filter5([1,2,3,4,5,6]))) . You are not wrong! However, composition gives you a convenient interface in case you want to do something like the following: . def fit(x, transforms:list): &quot;fit a model after performing transformations&quot; x = compose(*transforms)(x) y = [np.mean(x)] * len(x) # its a dumb model. Don&#39;t judge me return y # filters out elements &lt; 5, adds 2, then predicts the mean fit(x=[1,2,3,4,5,6], transforms=[filter5, add2]) . [7.5, 7.5] . For more information about compose, read the docs. . . A more useful __repr__ . In python, __repr__ helps you get information about an object for logging and debugging. Below is what you get by default when you define a new class. (Note: we are using store_attr, which was discussed earlier). . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() # `store_attr` was discussed previously Test(1) . &lt;__main__.Test at 0x7ffcd766cee0&gt; . We can use basic_repr to quickly give us a more sensible default: . class Test: def __init__(self, a, b=2, c=3): store_attr() __repr__ = basic_repr(&#39;a,b,c&#39;) Test(2) . Test(a=2, b=2, c=3) . . Monkey Patching With A Decorator . It can be convenient to monkey patch with a decorator, which is especially helpful when you want to patch an external library you are importing. We can use the decorator @patch from fastcore.foundation along with type hints like so: . class MyClass(int): pass @patch def func(self:MyClass, a): return self+a mc = MyClass(3) . Now, MyClass has an additional method named func: . mc.func(10) . 13 . Still not convinced? I&#39;ll show you another example of this kind of patching in the next section. . . A better pathlib.Path . When you see these extensions to pathlib.path you won&#39;t ever use vanilla pathlib again! A number of additional methods have been added to pathlib, such as: . Path.readlines: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.readlines() | Path.read: same as with open(&#39;somefile&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as f: f.read() | Path.save: saves file as pickle | Path.load: loads pickle file | Path.ls: shows the contents of the path as a list. | etc. | . Read more about this here. Here is a demonstration of ls: . from fastcore.utils import * from pathlib import Path p = Path(&#39;.&#39;) p.ls() # you don&#39;t get this with vanilla Pathlib.Path!! . (#7) [Path(&#39;2020-09-01-fastcore.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;README.md&#39;),Path(&#39;fastcore_imgs&#39;),Path(&#39;2020-02-20-test.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;.ipynb_checkpoints&#39;),Path(&#39;2020-02-21-introducing-fastpages.ipynb&#39;),Path(&#39;my_icons&#39;)] . Wait! What&#39;s going on here? We just imported pathlib.Path - why are we getting this new functionality? Thats because we imported the fastcore.utils module, which patches this module via the @patch decorator discussed earlier. Just to drive the point home on why the @patch decorator is useful, I&#39;ll go ahead and add another method to Path right now: . @patch def fun(self:Path): return &quot;This is fun!&quot; p.fun() . &#39;This is fun!&#39; . That is magical, right? I know! That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing about it! . . An Even More Concise Way To Create Lambdas . Self, with an uppercase S, is an even more concise way to create lambdas that are calling methods on an object. For example, let&#39;s create a lambda for taking the sum of a Numpy array: . arr=np.array([5,4,3,2,1]) f = lambda a: a.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . You can use Self in the same way: . f = Self.sum() assert f(arr) == 15 . Let&#39;s create a lambda that does a groupby and max of a Pandas dataframe: . import pandas as pd df=pd.DataFrame({&#39;Some Column&#39;: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, ], &#39;Another Column&#39;: [5, 7, 50, 70]}) f = Self.groupby(&#39;Some Column&#39;).mean() f(df) . Another Column . Some Column . a 6 | . b 60 | . Read more about Self in the docs). . . Notebook Functions . These are simple but handy, and allow you to know whether or not code is executing in a Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or an Ipython Shell: . from fastcore.imports import in_notebook, in_colab, in_ipython in_notebook(), in_colab(), in_ipython() . (True, False, True) . This is useful if you are displaying certain types of visualizations, progress bars or animations in your code that you may want to modify or toggle depending on the environment. . . A Drop-In Replacement For List . You might be pretty happy with Python&#39;s list. This is one of those situations that you don&#39;t know you needed a better list until someone showed one to you. Enter L, a list like object with many extra goodies. . The best way I can describe L is to pretend that list and numpy had a pretty baby: . define a list (check out the nice __repr__ that shows the length of the list!) . L(1,2,3) . (#3) [1,2,3] . Shuffle a list: . p = L.range(20).shuffle() p . (#20) [8,7,5,12,14,16,2,15,19,6...] . Index into a list: . p[2,4,6] . (#3) [5,14,2] . L has sensible defaults, for example appending an element to a list: . 1 + L(2,3,4) . (#4) [1,2,3,4] . There is much more L has to offer. Read the docs to learn more. . But Wait ... There&#39;s More! . There are more things I would like to show you about fastcore, but there is no way they would reasonably fit into a blog post. Here is a list of some of my favorite things that I didn&#39;t demo in this blog post: . Utilities . The Basics section contain many shortcuts to perform common tasks or provide an additional interface to what standard python provides. . mk_class: quickly add a bunch of attributes to a class | wrap_class: add new methods to a class with a simple decorator | groupby: similar to Scala&#39;s groupby | merge: merge dicts | fasttuple: a tuple on steroids | Infinite Lists: useful for padding and testing | chunked: for batching and organizing stuff | . Multiprocessing . The Multiprocessing section extends python&#39;s multiprocessing library by offering features like: . progress bars | ability to pause to mitigate race conditions with external services | processing things in batches on each worker, ex: if you have a vectorized operation to perform in chunks | . Functional Programming . The functional programming section is my favorite part of this library. . maps: a map that also composes functions | mapped: A more robust map | using_attr: compose a function that operates on an attribute | . Transforms . Transforms is a collection of utilities for creating data transformations and associated pipelines. These transformation utilities build upon many of the building blocks discussed in this blog post. . Further Reading . It should be noted that you should read the main page of the docs first, followed by the section on tests to fully understand the documentation. . The fastcore documentation site. | The fastcore GitHub repo. | Blog post on delegation. | . Shameless plug: fastpages . This blog post was written entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, which GitHub automatically converted into to a blog post! Sound interesting? Check out fastpages. .",

            "title": "Introducing fastpages",
            "content": ". We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of fastpages. fastpages is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as: . Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from Jupyter Notebooks; for instance see this great example post from Scott Hawley. Notebook posts support features such as: Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive. | Hide or show cell input and output. | Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default. | Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells | Ability to add links to Colab and GitHub automatically. | . | Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents. | Create and edit Markdown posts entirely online using GitHub&#39;s built-in markdown editor. | Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos. | Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability. | ... and much more | . fastpages relies on Github pages for hosting, and Github Actions to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don&#39;t have to fuss with conversion scripts. All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the &quot;View on GitHub&quot; link above. . fast.ai have previously released a similar project called fast_template, which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above. . Because fastpages is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible. fast_template may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github&#39;s integrated online editor. . Setting Up Fastpages . The setup process of fastpages is automated with GitHub Actions, too! Upon creating a repo from the fastpages template, a pull request will automatically be opened (after ~ 30 seconds) configuring your blog so it can start working. The automated pull request will greet you with instructions like this: . . All you have to do is follow these instructions (in the PR you receive) and your new blogging site will be up and running! . Jupyter Notebooks &amp; Fastpages . In this post, we will cover special features that fastpages provides for Jupyter notebooks. You can also write your blog posts with Word documents or markdown in fastpages, which contain many, but not all the same features. . Options via FrontMatter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . All of the above settings are enabled in this post, so you can see what they look like! . the summary field (preceeded by &gt;) will be displayed under your title, and will also be used by social media to display as the description of your page. | toc: setting this to true will automatically generate a table of contents | badges: setting this to true will display Google Colab and GitHub links on your blog post. | comments: setting this to true will enable comments. See these instructions for more details. | author this will display the authors names. | categories will allow your post to be categorized on a &quot;Tags&quot; page, where readers can browse your post by categories. | . Markdown front matter is formatted similarly to notebooks. The differences between the two can be viewed on the fastpages README. . Code Folding . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . If you want to completely hide cells (not just collapse them), read these instructions. . Interactive Charts With Altair . Interactive visualizations made with Altair remain interactive! . We leave this below cell unhidden so you can enjoy a preview of syntax highlighting in fastpages, which uses the Dracula theme. . label = alt.selection_single( encodings=[&#39;x&#39;], # limit selection to x-axis value on=&#39;mouseover&#39;, # select on mouseover events nearest=True, # select data point nearest the cursor empty=&#39;none&#39; # empty selection includes no data points ) # define our base line chart of stock prices base = alt.Chart().mark_line().encode( alt.X(&#39;date:T&#39;), alt.Y(&#39;price:Q&#39;, scale=alt.Scale(type=&#39;log&#39;)), alt.Color(&#39;symbol:N&#39;) ) alt.layer( base, # base line chart # add a rule mark to serve as a guide line alt.Chart().mark_rule(color=&#39;#aaa&#39;).encode( x=&#39;date:T&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add circle marks for selected time points, hide unselected points base.mark_circle().encode( opacity=alt.condition(label, alt.value(1), alt.value(0)) ).add_selection(label), # add white stroked text to provide a legible background for labels base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5, stroke=&#39;white&#39;, strokeWidth=2).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), # add text labels for stock prices base.mark_text(align=&#39;left&#39;, dx=5, dy=-5).encode( text=&#39;price:Q&#39; ).transform_filter(label), data=stocks ).properties( width=500, height=400 ) .

How fastpages Converts Notebooks to Blog Posts . fastpages uses nbdev to power the conversion process of Jupyter Notebooks to blog posts. When you save a notebook into the /_notebooks folder of your repository, GitHub Actions applies nbdev against those notebooks automatically. The same process occurs when you save Word documents or markdown files into the _word or _posts directory, respectively. . We will discuss how GitHub Actions work in a follow up blog post. . Resources &amp; Next Steps . We highly encourage you to start blogging with fastpages! Some resources that may be helpful: . fastpages repo - this is where you can go to create your own fastpages blog! | Fastai forums - nbdev &amp; blogging category.
